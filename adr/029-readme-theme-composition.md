# ADR-029: README Theme Composition

## Status

Active. Update this document when the contract changes.

## Decision

The project README is composed by native mdtheme from `README.md.src`. The
outer frame is Sebastian Software; Ferramenta is the inner frame. Footers close
in reverse order. The project content remains the main focus; shared branding
is compact and maintained upstream. The Ferramenta footer excludes this project
and includes sibling descriptions and the family icon.

Pin the CLI with mise and both Git theme revisions in mdtheme.yaml. CI checks
the generated output. Source and output are committed together. Standards
repositories explicitly delegate README ownership to mdtheme, so standards
cannot append a second company footer. Published subpackage READMEs keep their
compact registry format and existing generator.

## Consequences

Contributors edit the source, then regenerate. No JavaScript configuration or
Node installation is needed for the root README. Shared theme updates are
reviewable Git diffs. Rendering requires network access to the Git sources.

See [the contributor guide](https://github.com/sebastian-software/palamedes/blob/main/docs/readme-theme.md) for commands.
